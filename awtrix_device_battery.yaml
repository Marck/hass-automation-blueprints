blueprint:
  name: "[AWTRIX] Device Battery Monitor"
  description: >
    This blueprint will print out the battery status of a device available to home assistant and will refresh every minute.
    It uses a custom icon set you need to install.

    You can find all the icons [here](https://github.com/t3kmor/AWTRIXDeviceBatteryMonitor/tree/main/icons/)
    
    It also requires a template sensor with the uptime of your Awtrix device in seconds. See 'Last reported helper' field for more information.
